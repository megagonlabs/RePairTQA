You are given a list of column names from a database table, along with a sample value for each column.

Your task consists of two steps:

---

**Step 1: Column Suitability Classification**

Label each column as either:
- "YES": if the column is descriptive and human-interpretable (e.g., name, title, category, price, quantity, location, status).
- "NO": if it is a technical field or metadata column (e.g., id, uuid, product_id, created_at, URL) that is unlikely to appear in a natural-language description.

---
**Step 2: Column Combination Generation**

From the columns labeled "YES", generate a small number of diverse and meaningful combinations (ideally 2–5). Each combination should:

- Contain only columns labeled "YES"
- Include several columns (based on availability, usually should more than two)
- Avoid repeating the same column in a single combination
- Be suitable for use in a natural-language sentence such as:
  > “{{product_name}} is sold by {{supplier_name}} for {{price}}.”

If only one or two YES columns exist, just generate 1 or 2 simple combinations.

Avoid bad combinations like:
["ATT_CLASS", "ATT_CLASS"]
["ATT_CLASS_ID"] if it was labeled "NO"

**Input:**

Database: {db}  
Table: {table}

Columns with sample values:
{cols}

---

**Example:**

Columns = [product_name, price, category, product_id, created_at, stock_quantity, supplier_name]  
Example Output:
[
  ["product_name", "price", "category"],
  ["product_name", "supplier_name"],
  ["product_name", "stock_quantity", "price"]
]

---

**Your Output Format:**

```json
{{
  "column_classification": {{
    "column_name_1": "YES",
    "column_name_2": "NO"
  }},
  "combinations": [
    ...
  ]
}}
